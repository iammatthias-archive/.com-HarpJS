        <p>
        My site has gone through a lot of changes over the years, and the reasons have varried considerably.
        </p>
</div>
  <div class="column is-one-third-tablet is-5-desktop has-text-left">
      <p>I started this as a photographer.</p>
<p>My first camera was film affair, courtesy of my grandfather. The switch to digital came shortly after, and at 16 I launched my first website, the short lived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110202043029/http://mkjimagery.com/">http://mkjimagery.com</a>(link provided by the Internet Archive). It was a Flash based nightmare produced by the horrible web publishing tools in Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>I had arrived on the digital frontier.</p>
<p>Since that first launch my web presence has undergone multiple evolutions. I had the &quot;too much time on social media&quot; phase, followed quickly by an ill-advised attempt to use early Tumblr as a CMS in 2008. I dabbled in Wordpress, gave up my domain and used Flickr, started over upon realizing the need for a site, and built a new site in 2013 using <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> for the backend. And then for some reason I launched a barebones landing page on GitHub Pages, and pointed the photography section at <a href="http://exposure.co">Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>I stayed with that bounce-rate inflating system for awhile.</p>
<p>This time I decided to do something different. Static sites are coming back in a big way, which is a good thing. Build tools are popping up left and right, Jekyll has been the standard for a few years now, while tools like Hugo, Middleman, and Brunch have carved out their own cult followings. After trying more than I care to admit, I fell in love with <a href="http://harpjs.com">HarpJS</a>. Harp is a static web server with built-in preprocessing, and it rocks. I paired it with an EJS template(partials are the best), <a href="https://milligram.github.io">Milligram</a> CSS, a hint of jquery, and a few days of my time. A JSON file handles the metadata for the blog, and the entire product is backed up on GitHub, while the always wonderful <a href="http://surge.sh">Surge.sh</a> handles my deployment with 6 easy keystrokes.</p>
<p>That was a long way of announcing that I have completed a redesign of my website. As I transition away from being a professional photographer, and towards being a product manager, I knew that I would need to invest some time in my web presence.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>
<p>A new beginning.</p>
