I started this as a photographer.

My first camera was film affair, courtesy of my grandfather. The switch to digital came shortly after, and at 16 I launched my first website, the short lived [http://mkjimagery.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20110202043029/http://mkjimagery.com/)(link provided by the Internet Archive). It was a Flash based nightmare produced by the horrible web publishing tools in Adobe Lightroom.

I had arrived on the digital frontier.

Since that first launch my web presence has undergone multiple evolutions. I had the "too much time on social media" phase, followed quickly by an ill-advised attempt to use early Tumblr as a CMS in 2008. I dabbled in Wordpress, gave up my domain and used Flickr, started over upon realizing the need for a site, and built a new site in 2013 using [Ghost](http://ghost.org) for the backend. And then for some reason I launched a barebones landing page on GitHub Pages, and pointed the photography section at [Exposure](http://exposure.co).

I stayed with that bounce-rate inflating system for awhile.

This time I decided to do something different. Static sites are coming back in a big way, which is a good thing. Build tools are popping up left and right, Jekyll has been the standard for a few years now, while tools like Hugo, Middleman, and Brunch have carved out their own cult followings. After trying more than I care to admit, I fell in love with [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com). Harp is a static web server with built-in preprocessing, and it rocks. I paired it with an EJS template(partials are the best), [Milligram](https://milligram.github.io) CSS, a hint of jquery, and a few days of my time. A JSON file handles the metadata for the blog, and the entire product is backed up on GitHub, while the always wonderful [Surge.sh](http://surge.sh) handles my deployment with 6 easy keystrokes.

That was a long way of announcing that I have completed a redesign of my website. As I transition away from being a professional photographer, and towards being a product manager, I knew that I would need to invest some time in my web presence.

And here we are.

A new beginning.
