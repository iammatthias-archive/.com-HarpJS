  <b>type.css</b> is a small css module (683 bytes) that is easy to modify or extend to fit your needs. 
Abstracting your font-sizes into simple single purpose classes targeting individual breakpoints can help improve your sites css performance and reduce code bloat.
  Adjusting font-sizes and designing around content in the browser becomes easy as sunday morning.

As a vortex forms in dark clouds above his house, Donnie drives into the hills and watches as an airplane descends above. The plane, carrying Rose and the dance troupe, is wrenched violently as one of its engines detaches and falls into the vortex. Events of the previous 28 days recapitulate in reverse order and action, until Donnie finds himself in bed in the early hours of October 2. As he sits laughing uncontrollably, the jet engine crashes through his room, killing him.

      <p class="f5-m lh-copy mw6">Others with whom Donnie had interacted in the 28 days awaken, some looking disturbed. Gretchen rides by Donnie's house and learns of his death from a neighborhood boy (Scotty Leavenworth), but says she did not know him. Gretchen and Rose exchange a glance and wave as if they know one another, but cannot remember where from.</p>
