/* BUILT WITH */

## Technology
* [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com)
- The site was built using [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com). It's a great static site generator, and a fantastic JS based alternative to platforms like Jekyll(Ruby), Middleman(Ruby), or Hugo(Go). Harp bills itself as "The static web server with built-in preprocessing." and has built in support for Jade, Markdown, EJS, CoffeeScript, Sass, LESS and Stylus.

* [Bulma](http://bulma.io)
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io) is a fairly new, modern CSS framework based on Flexbox. You can use it as a single CSS file, or mess with the SASS source itself. It's lightweight, and has some pretty impressive features.

* [Btns](http://mrmrs.io/btns/)
* [Colors](http://clrs.cc)
* [Links](http://mrmrs.io/links/)
* [Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/)

* [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh)
- [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh) is the bee's knees. Surge lets you publish HTML, CSS, and JS for free, without leaving the command line. It's remarkably easy, and is a cakewalk to integrate with platforms like Travis.Cl for continuous integration.

* [Jquery](http://jquery.com)
* [jquery.lazyload](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)
* [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/)
* [CookieBar](http://carlwoodhouse.github.io/jquery.cookieBar/)
* [ScrollSpy](https://github.com/sxalexander/jquery-scrollspy)
* [Macy](http://macyjs.com)
