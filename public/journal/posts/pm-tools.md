Tools are useful. Web tools, especially. Connectivity, extensibility, and automation, coming together to make our lives easier.

So what tools do I use on a daily basis?

### Slack

Slack is probably my single most used app right now. I use it with multiple teams to share files, resources, and to collaborate on different tasks. It’s a chat tool, a scheduling tool, and a personal assistant all in one. And thanks to the stellar app integrations, Slack plays nicely with the other tools we’ll get into on this list.

### Trello

Trello is great. I use Trello boards to organize small personal projects, like cooking recipes. I also use Trello to automate posting updates to Slack teams. Whenever a card is moved over and marked as done, Slack gets pinged, everyone is in the loop. This let’s me keep a living log of who is working on what, and at what time.

### Google Drive / Dropbox

Two different platforms, but they are similar enough that I feel comfortable addressing them simultainiously. Teams always need methods for sharing files. Sometimes it’s a design comp from UX, other times it might be a full directory of deliverables for a client. Either way, cloud platforms that allow for document storage and collaboration are fantastic.

### Invision

Invision is one of my favorite platforms on this list. They are one of the big names on the prototyping campus, and have more than earned their reputation. With a simple click and drag interface, it is trivial to quickly build out clickable prototypes. Being able to link the screens to a Sketch document stored on Dropbox takes it to the next level. When I update the Sketch file on my computer, Invision updates the prototype.


Those are the four tools I frequently use as a PM. What tools do you like?
