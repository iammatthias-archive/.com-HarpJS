- HarpJS - The static web server with built-in preprocessing.
  - HarpJS is fantastic. Like a lot of people on the web, my first exposure to static site generators was Jekyll. That led me to Middleman, which led me to Brunch, then Hugo, then Metalsmith. Every single tool was absolutely fantastic, but Harp just made sense in my workflow.

- Milligram CSS - Milligram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting point.
  - Milligram is a sort of spiritual successor to Skeleton. I loved Skeleton, back when it was maintained on a regular basis. Milligram is extremely light-weight, while still being very full featured.

- Surge.sh - Simple, single-command web publishing.
  - Surge. I love Surge. I dabbled with DeployBot, I hosted using GitHub Pages, and I've managed my own Digital Ocean instances. Nothing has come close to the ease of use with Surge. If you're looking for a new deploy tool, it's worth checking out.
