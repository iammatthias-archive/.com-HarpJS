I have been fortunate enough to be a part of a few different interesting ventures over the years. Producing/promoting events, dabbling in crowdfunding, and hanging images in galleries. This is a little different. 

My first day with Surf Air was on September 15th. I had first interviewed back in mid-June, and made a persistent nuisance of myself for the rest of the summer. I followed up multiple times a week, and constantly pushed for meetings over lunch or coffee. 

And it paid off. 

I am writing this at the end of my first full week. Looking back, I really can’t believe how quickly this has ‘taken off’. The team is vivacious, and full of life. Everyone is friendly, which produces a truly infectious office atmosphere. Ideas bounce off of the walls and team members, and everyone is constantly working on something new. 

This is an amazing opportunity, one I am eternally grateful to pursue. I can not wait to see what I learn as a part of this amazing company.
