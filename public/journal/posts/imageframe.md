## [Live Demo](http://imgframe.surge.sh)

This takes the source of an image and applies it to the div background, and the enclosed img tag. This displays with picture with a copy of itself as a border frame. Can be modified so that the background image is contained to the size of the div, or it can be left as is to provide a more dynamic feel when the window is resized.

As I was working on this, I decided to create three different implementations for this project. I started with vanilla Javascript, and then reworked it to leverage two template languages: [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com) and [Jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)(now called Pug).

A [ReadMe](https://github.com/iammatthias/frame) documenting how to use this can be found on the Github Repo: https://github.com/iammatthias/frame
